# AP Database SQL Query Practice

This project is a SQL class practice focused on querying data from the AP (Accounts Payable) sample database.

## Project Objective
Practice core SQL querying skills using real tables (`vendors`, `invoices`) and business-style filtering scenarios.

## What I Learned

Through this practice, I learned how to:

- Set and use a default database with `USE ap`
- Retrieve data using `SELECT` with all columns or selected columns
- Filter records using `WHERE` with:
  - equality (`=`)
  - comparison (`>`)
  - logical operators (`AND`, `OR`)
  - list filtering (`IN`, `NOT IN`)
  - date range filtering (`BETWEEN`, and explicit date boundaries)
- Sort results using `ORDER BY` (including descending order)
- Rank and paginate records using `LIMIT` and `OFFSET`
- Combine tables using `JOIN ... ON ...`
- Improve query readability using table aliases (e.g., `invoices i`, `vendors v`)

## SQL Techniques Used

### 1) Basic Selection
- `SELECT * FROM invoices;`
- `SELECT vendor_id, vendor_name, vendor_state FROM vendors;`

### 2) Conditional Filtering
- State and city filters (`CA`, `WI`, `Los Angeles`)
- Multi-condition logic with `AND` / `OR`
- List filters with `IN` and exclusion using `NOT IN`
- Amount filter: invoices with `invoice_total > 100`

### 3) Date Filtering
- Filtering June 2018 invoices with:
  - `BETWEEN '2018-06-01' AND '2018-06-30'`
  - boundary comparisons (`>=`, `<=`)
  - exclusive range (`>`, `<`)

### 4) Sorting and Top-N Queries
- Highest invoice totals with `ORDER BY invoice_total DESC`
- Top 5 rows with `LIMIT 5`
- Pagination style query with `LIMIT ... OFFSET ...`

### 5) Join Queries
- Joining `invoices` and `vendors` on `vendor_id`
- Filtering joined results by specific vendor names
- Using aliases for cleaner SQL syntax

## File Included
- `ap-database-query-practice.sql`

## Tools
- MySQL / MySQL Workbench

## Outcome
This exercise strengthened my ability to write practical SQL queries for business analysis tasks, especially for filtering, ranking, and combining transactional and master data.
