# SQL Summary Queries, GROUP BY, HAVING, and ROLLUP Practice

This project contains SQL practice focused on aggregate analysis in the `ap` database, using `invoices` and `vendors` tables.

## Project Objective
Learn how to summarize transactional data and generate grouped insights for business reporting.

## Database Used
- `ap`
  - `invoices`
  - `vendors`

## What I Learned

Through this practice, I learned how to:

- Use aggregate functions:
  - `COUNT()`
  - `SUM()`
  - `MIN()`
  - `MAX()`
  - `AVG()`
  - `ROUND()`
- Distinguish row counting vs value summation  
  (e.g., `COUNT(*)` vs `SUM(invoice_total)`)
- Calculate derived metrics such as:
  - `balance_due = invoice_total - payment_total - credit_total`
- Group data with `GROUP BY` to produce vendor-level summaries
- Sort grouped results using `ORDER BY`
- Filter grouped results using `HAVING`
- Combine `WHERE` (pre-group filter) and `HAVING` (post-group filter)
- Generate subtotal/grand-total style outputs with `WITH ROLLUP`
- Build ranked summary outputs with `LIMIT` and `OFFSET`

## SQL Techniques Demonstrated

### 1) Core Aggregation
- Total number of invoices
- Number of distinct vendors in invoice records
- Total invoice amount
- Minimum, maximum, and average invoice amounts
- Rounded average for cleaner reporting

### 2) Balance Analysis
- Identify invoices with unpaid balances
- Separate fully paid vs outstanding invoices
- Use computed columns for financial interpretation

### 3) Grouped Vendor Analysis
- Invoice count per vendor
- Total invoice value per vendor
- Vendor ranking by total invoice value
- Joined summary (`invoices` + `vendors`) to include `vendor_name`

### 4) Advanced Grouping
- Group by `vendor_state` and `vendor_city`
- Use `WITH ROLLUP` for subtotal/total style output

### 5) Post-Aggregation Filtering
- Apply `HAVING` for grouped thresholds  
  (e.g., only vendors with total invoice value > 100)
- Combine:
  - `WHERE` for row-level filtering (e.g., May 2018 invoices)
  - `HAVING` for group-level conditions

## File Included
- `sql-aggregation-groupby-having-practice.sql`

## Tools
- MySQL / MySQL Workbench

## Outcome
This exercise improved my ability to transform raw transaction records into decision-ready summaries, a key SQL skill for financial and business analytics.
