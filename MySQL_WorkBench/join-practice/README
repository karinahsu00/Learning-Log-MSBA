# Department & Employee JOIN Practice (SQL)

This project contains SQL class practice for understanding and comparing different JOIN types using `employees` and `departments` tables in the `ex` database.

## Project Objective
Learn how different JOIN operations affect query results when combining employee and department data.

## What I Learned

Through this practice, I learned how to:

- Use `INNER JOIN` to return only matched records from both tables
- Use `LEFT JOIN` to keep all employees, including those without matching departments
- Use `RIGHT JOIN` to keep all departments, including those without employees
- Simulate a `FULL OUTER JOIN` in MySQL by combining `LEFT JOIN` and `RIGHT JOIN` with `UNION`
- Use table aliases (`e`, `d`) to write cleaner and more readable SQL

## SQL Techniques Used

### 1) Set Database Context
- `USE ex;`

### 2) INNER JOIN
Returns only rows where `employees.department_number = departments.department_number`.

### 3) LEFT JOIN
Returns all rows from `employees` plus matching rows from `departments`.  
If no matching department exists, department columns return `NULL`.

### 4) RIGHT JOIN
Returns all rows from `departments` plus matching rows from `employees`.  
If no employees are assigned, employee columns return `NULL`.

### 5) FULL OUTER JOIN (MySQL workaround)
Because MySQL does not natively support `FULL OUTER JOIN`, this script uses:

- `LEFT JOIN`
- `UNION`
- `RIGHT JOIN`

to return all matched and unmatched rows from both tables.

## File Included
- `join-practice.sql`

## Tools
- MySQL / MySQL Workbench

## Outcome
This exercise improved my understanding of relational joins and helped me compare how each join type supports different business reporting needs (employee-centered view vs. department-centered view).
