# SQL Comprehensive Query Practice

This project is a comprehensive SQL class practice script covering core querying techniques across multiple databases: `ap`, `ex`, and `university`.

## Project Objective
Build a strong SQL foundation by practicing real query scenarios including filtering, sorting, joins, pattern matching, regular expressions, and date operations.

## Databases Used
- `ap` (Accounts Payable): `vendors`, `invoices`
- `ex` (HR-style examples): `employees`, `departments`
- `university`: `students`

## What I Learned

Through this practice, I strengthened my ability to:

- Switch database contexts using `USE ...`
- Retrieve records with `SELECT` (all columns and selected columns)
- Apply conditional filters using:
  - `WHERE`
  - `AND`, `OR`
  - `IN`, `NOT IN`
- Sort output using `ORDER BY` (single and multi-column sorting)
- Build top-N and pagination-style queries with `LIMIT` and `OFFSET`
- Join related tables using:
  - `INNER JOIN`
  - `LEFT JOIN`
  - `RIGHT JOIN`
  - Simulated `FULL OUTER JOIN` via `UNION`
  - Comparison of `UNION` vs `UNION ALL`
- Perform text pattern matching using:
  - `LIKE` wildcards (`%`)
  - `REGEXP` anchors and character sets (`^`, `$`, `[ ]`)
- Filter by date using:
  - Date ranges (`BETWEEN`, `<`, `>`)
  - Date functions (`YEAR()`, `MONTH()`, `DAY()`)

## SQL Techniques Demonstrated

### 1) Filtering & Projection
- State and city-based vendor filters
- Multi-condition logic (`AND`/`OR`)
- List-based filtering (`IN` / `NOT IN`)

### 2) Sorting & Ranking
- Descending ranking by invoice amount
- Multi-key sorting by state and vendor ID
- Top records and offset pagination

### 3) Join Operations
- Invoice-to-vendor joins in `ap`
- Employee-to-department joins in `ex`
- Full coverage joins using `LEFT JOIN + RIGHT JOIN + UNION`

### 4) String Search
- Prefix/suffix/contains matching with `LIKE`
- Advanced name pattern matching with `REGEXP`

### 5) Date Analysis
- Month-specific invoice filtering
- Exact day filtering
- Inclusive and exclusive date range logic

## File Included
- `sql-foundations-and-joins-practice.sql`

## Tools
- MySQL / MySQL Workbench

## Outcome
This script demonstrates practical SQL fluency for business analytics workflows: extracting, filtering, combining, and validating structured data across different schemas.
