# SQL Database Design Homework 1

This repository contains my SQL database design work for two relational database scenarios:

1. Student Courses Database
2. Movie Rental Database

Both projects were designed with clear entity relationships, primary/foreign key constraints, and normalized table structures.

## Project 1: Student Courses Database

Objective
Design a relational database to manage students, courses, instructors, classrooms, and course registrations.

Entities Included
- Student
- Course
- Instructor
- Classroom
- Registration (junction table between Student and Course)

Key Design Concepts Used
- Primary Keys for unique entity identification  
- Foreign Keys to enforce referential integrity  
- Many-to-Many Relationship resolved using a bridge table (Registration)  
- One-to-Many Relationships:
  - Instructor → Course
  - Classroom → Course
- Basic normalization to reduce redundancy and improve data consistency

Files
- `Student Courses.sql`: SQL schema script
- `Diagram_Student Courses.png`: ER diagram
- `Student Courses.mwb`: MySQL Workbench model
- `HW1_Karina_Hsu.docx`: assignment write-up

## Project 2: Movie Rental Database

Objective
Design a database for a movie rental business to track disks, categories, sellers, customers, and rental transactions.

Entities Included
- Disk
- Category
- Seller
- Customer
- Rental

Key Design Concepts Used
- **Primary/Foreign key mapping** across core transaction tables  
- **Transaction table design** in `Rental` with checkout/return date attributes  
- **Referential integrity** between inventory and customer rental activity  
- Clear relationship modeling for inventory ownership and rental history

Files
- `Diagram_AI Movie Rental Database.png`: ER diagram
- `HW1_Karina_Hsu.docx`: assignment write-up

Tools & Technologies
- MySQL Workbench (ER modeling and schema design)
- MySQL SQL (DDL scripts and relational constraints)

Learning Outcomes
Through this homework, I practiced:
- Translating business requirements into relational schemas
- Building ER diagrams and mapping relationships correctly
- Implementing PK/FK constraints in SQL
- Designing structured, readable database project documentation
