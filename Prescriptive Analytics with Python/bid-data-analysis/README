# GBA468 Assignment 1 — Bid Data Analysis

This repository contains my submission for GBA468 / GBA468P Assignment 1, focused on analyzing bid-related data and documenting the workflow in notebook and report formats.

## Project Objective
The goal of this assignment is to practice a complete analytics workflow:
- load and inspect raw bid data,
- clean and prepare data for analysis,
- perform exploratory analysis,
- generate insights and interpretations,
- present findings in reproducible and shareable formats.

## Methods & Techniques Used
This assignment demonstrates core business analytics practices, including:
- data loading and validation
- data cleaning and preprocessing
- exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- summary statistics and pattern identification
- analytical interpretation and business-oriented conclusions
- reproducible reporting via Jupyter Notebook and exported deliverables (HTML/PDF)

## Tools
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Common analytics libraries (e.g., pandas / numpy / matplotlib, depending on notebook implementation)
- HTML/PDF export for final reporting

## Learning Outcomes
Through this assignment, I strengthened my ability to:
- structure a full analytics project from raw data to final report,
- communicate results clearly in both technical and non-technical formats,
- maintain reproducible analysis artifacts suitable for academic and professional review.
